# Mirai Refresh

This is the public version of Mirai. Old version is currently avaliable at https://miraianime.stream/

The project is undergoing a major refresh based on the feedback we received when it was active and functioning. A nice hint would be no more social features.

We're currently planning out how to make the content streamable to other hosters in a legal way.

Due to a recent legalisation change in the laws of streamable content in Norway, we cannot allow content to be viewable on our own. The source is avaliable to others who wishes a fresh UX to work on top of for their service, or third-parties that want to drive the web-app with the content legally viewable. If you're a publisher who is interested in making your anime content viewable on Mirai, then we'd be happy to discuss on about the possibilities.
