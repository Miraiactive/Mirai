# Mirai (public edition)

This is the source code of Mirai. It's currently under development with several new releases coming out lately.
The code does no longer have any connections with the code the edition of the school project had.
_This is the public edition of Mirai_

Latest version is 1.0.1 on the [public domain](https://miraianime.stream/)

## Collaborators

This edition of Mirai is open to developers to pull requests and etc.
Make sure you got `nodejs` and `yarn` installed. The code is written in ES6 syntax and utilizies plenty of what ES6 has to offer for JavaScript.
Currently it's bootstraped with `create-react-app` but will be ejected in near future. Configuration files to the database and minor tokens are absent from the source code for security reasons.
